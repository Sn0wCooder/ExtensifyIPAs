## How to manually create IPAs with Exos

### Requirements:

1. A computer running macOS;
2. [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) installed;
3. [iTunes (latest version)](https://api.ipsw.me/v2.1/iTunes/osx/latest/url/dl);
4. [optool](https://github.com/alexzielenski/optool) (to install it, follow the guide);
5. [Cydia Impactor](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com);
6. Extensify Exo you need (available [here](https://github.com/Sn0wCooder/Extensify-Exos));
7. An iOS device connected to the computer.

### Guide:

### 1. Install _optool_ binary (only for the first time)

To install _optool_ (only for the first time), open Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal) and digit this command: ```cd /usr/bin && sudo curl -OL https://github.com/alexzielenski/optool/releases/download/0.1/optool.zip && sudo unzip /usr/bin/optool.zip -d /usr/bin && sudo rm -rf optool.zip```.

At the beginning, Terminal will ask you Administrator’s password. Enter it and continue (while you write it you will not see anything, but you’ll be writing correctly!).

To check if _optool_ is installed correctly, digit _optool_ on Terminal, and it will show you this:

![optool-terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sn0wCooder/ExtensifyIPAs/master/img/optool_terminal.png "optool-terminal")

### 2. Download/create cracked/decrypted version of the app you want to sideload

If you want to create decrypted IPAs, you can use some tools for your Jailbroken device, such as [_clutch_](https://github.com/KJCracks/Clutch) or [_Rasticrac_](https://iosgods.com/topic/11571-tutorial-how-to-use-rasticrac-to-crack-an-app-then-thin-the-binary/).

If you want to download cracked IPAs, Google is your friend :D

### 3. Unpack IPA

Right click on IPA file previously, choose Open With and select Archive Utility.

![unpack-ipa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sn0wCooder/ExtensifyIPAs/master/img/unpack_IPA.png "unpack-ipa")

### 4. Injecting dylib(s)

Open Terminal and digit the following codes:

```optool install -c load -p @executable_path/[NameOfDylib].dylib -t [APPEXEC]```

```[NameOfDylib]``` is the name of the dylib we are injecting in the app, while ```[APPEXEC]``` is the executable of the IPA (in the Payload folder of the decrypted app).

For example: ```optool install -c load -p @executable_path/Cercube.dylib -t /Users/Leonardo/Desktop/YouTube/Payload/YouTube.app/YouTube```.

The output should be similar to this one:

![optool-installed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sn0wCooder/ExtensifyIPAs/master/img/optool-installed.png "optool-installed")

**If there are more dylibs, you have to inject all in the app.**

### 5. Copy files in the main directory of the application

Now you have to copy **ALL** the dylib(s) (and eventually the _.bundle_) in the main directory of the _.app_.

### 6. Compress Payload folder

Then you have to compress the Payload folder to a ZIP file.

![compressfiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sn0wCooder/ExtensifyIPAs/master/img/compressfiles.png "compressfiles")

### 7. Sign the IPA with Cydia Impactor

To do it, follow the following guide.

**NOTE**: If you want to make the IPA as close as possible to Extensify, you can add a "+" at the end of the app name in the HomeScreen by editing the entry "CFBundleDisplayName" in the _Info.plist_ file located in the application zip.

## How to Sideload on non-Jailbroken devices

### Requirements:

1. A computer running macOS, Windows or Linux;
2. Internet connection;
3. Apple ID (email & password).

#### Guide:

* Download the IPA file from the link above or create it;
* Download Cydia Impactor for the OS of your choice from [here](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com) and run it;
* Remove any instances of the original apps that are currently installed on your iOS device;
* Connect your iOS device and hit "Trust" if prompted. Your device will appear in Cydia Impactor now;
* Drag the IPA file from your Desktop to Cydia Impactor;

![Help 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sn0wCooder/ExtensifyIPAs/master/img/help1.png "Help 1")

* Enter your Apple ID email address when prompted;

![Help 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sn0wCooder/ExtensifyIPAs/master/img/help2.png "Help 2")

* Enter Your Apple ID password when prompted;

![Help 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sn0wCooder/ExtensifyIPAs/master/img/help3.png "Help 3")

* If you get an alert like the following, press "OK";

![Help 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sn0wCooder/ExtensifyIPAs/master/img/help4.png "Help 4")

* Wait for Cydia Impactor to finish then open the app on your iOS device.

**Don't forget you have to do to repeat this every week!**
